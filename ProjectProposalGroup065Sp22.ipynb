    "> ***Preface***:<br> \n",
    "> Our group was motivated by a recent fatal accident in our home country China, in which the crash of the China Eastern plane on Monday, March 21st, killed all 132 people aboard. Therefore, while grieving the loss of those lives, we want to take the COGS 108 project as an opportunity to explore the history of world aircraft crashes and mourn all losses involved in those accidents…\n",
    "\n",
    "Such tragedies are rarely reported worldwide nowadays, as the development of technology and the industry seems to improve the safety of air travel and indeed studies shows that the number of airplane crashes and fatalities decreased over the last century [^Miyamoto]. Certainly, the increase in technology and architecture of planes may reduce the risk of airplane crashes. \n",
    "\n",
    "Airplane crashes result from multiple factors that affect the aircraft and the reasons for airplane crashes vary from case to case, and even the reason for some still remains as mysteries. Commonly reported factors linked to airplane crashes include abnormal airplane conditions, pilot errors, and unfavorable natural conditions for flights such as air turbulence or extreme weather conditions.[^Oster]\n",
    "\n",
    "Compared to larger airplanes, smaller commuter planes tend to have a higher fatality rate, and off-airport location is one of the most critical factors for the fatality of pilots. [^Guohua] We believe that time and location factors matter for the severity of the crashes. \n",

Therefore, we are cautious that our study will only draw **correlational NOT causal conclusions**.   \n",

Although we can never make causaul inference from this dataset, we can run additional statistical tests to ensure the validity of the correlations. \n",
